MLX90621 Arduino and Processing example code

Particle code for the Melexis MLX90621 16x4 thermopile array.


The MLX90621 FIRray temperature sensing device from Melexis utilizes the company’s non-contact 
temperature measurement technology to create a highly cost-effective thermography solution. 
Covering a -20°C to 300°C temperature range, this 16 x 4 element far infrared (FIR) thermopile 
sensor array produces a map of heat values for the target area in real time, avoiding the need to 
scan the area with a single point sensor or use an expensive microbolometer device.

In use in VU and Tilburg University temperature cry detection project.

Implements MaxBot's MLX90621 Arduino library patched with KMoto's minor change in defaultConfig_H.
